Hi there, Welcome to my world!
Let me introduce myself,

I am **Josué G.**, a Computer Science major at Dartmouth College graduating in 2026. Guided by the principle to 'explore many realms yet master one', I've honed in on AI, especially **NLP for African languages**. As a Computer Science major, I'm fervently exploring intersections of tech, global health, and linguistics, with an aspiration to be an AI researcher driving social impact.
